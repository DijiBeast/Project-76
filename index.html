		<p>	A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that
			even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter
			has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star
			is dying. Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes. They are invisible.
			Space telescopes with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see
			how stars that are very close to black holes act differently than
			other stars.

		<p id="conclusion-text">	Neither wormholes or black holes have actually ever been seen directly, even with the sophisticated equipment in use today, but both follow inevitably from Albert Einsteinâ€™s General Theory of Relativity, and plenty of indirect evidence has been obtained (at least for black holes). The ideas have certainly been more than readily accepted by the science fiction community, for whom they suggest intriguing possibilities.</p>
